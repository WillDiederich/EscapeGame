# EscapeGame

This is a relatively simple 3D game written in Java using my universities in-house game engine.

All of the character models and some of the textures were created by me using blender, the other textures (such as the brick, grass, and stone textures) were found on the internet. 

I extended the physics engine to allow for more accurate collision detection and more robust collision handling methods.
